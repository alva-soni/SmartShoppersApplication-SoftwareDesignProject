Background: The SmartShoppers system is an online system that allows customers to find products in the physical
retail stores with a greater precision. The main goal of the software system is to provide the customers with a
faster and smooth shopping experience in store. SmartShoppers would allow customers to find the products that are
available in a specific store and its location in the store. This product will have many benefits to the customer and
the SmartShoppers Inc. The customer will have financial benefits as they are able to save money by being provided
all the on-sale items. The customer also is able to find recommended products which they might not have had a
chance to find in store. The customer saves time shopping because they know the exact locations of the products
which they would like to purchase. ShoppersLand Inc. would benefit financially as they will sell more products
because of the SmartShoppers online system. ShoppersLand’s employees would also be able to work efficiently as
they will be asked fewer questions by the customers regarding the products
